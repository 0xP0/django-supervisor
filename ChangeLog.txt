v0.1.1:

  * project-specific config:  allow a [program:__overrides__] section to
    override options in all program sections at once.  Useful for things
    like globally switching autostart on/off.
  * app-specific config files:  use only one of management/supervisord.conf
    or contrib/<appname>/supervisord.conf, never both.  This prevent us
    from accidentally conflicting with settings specified by app authors.

v0.1.0:

  * initial release; you might say *everything* has changed.
